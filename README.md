# Hephzibah-Idunuolwa-Bolorunduro_AIIP_Community-Chatbot-For-Free-C.C.F.F- I choose a chatbot because it provides a
unique opportunity for interaction, especially when feelings of loneliness arise. In moments when you may not have someone
physically present to talk to, the chatbot serves as a comforting alternative. It allows
you to engage in conversation and express your thoughts and feelings without
judgment. This interaction can help to ease the loneliness and provide a sense of
connection, even if it is with a virtual assistant. Chatbots are available at any
time, making them a reliable option for those seeking companionship or someone to talk
to, which can be particularly valuable during difficult times. By using the chatbot, you can
find some relief from the isolation that might come with being alone, making it an
important tool for emotional support.
